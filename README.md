# Smart Ambulance Traffic Control System

This project is a smart traffic management solution designed to provide priority passage for ambulances at traffic signals. The system focuses on reducing emergency response time by dynamically managing traffic flow.

## Project Overview

The project is developed as a **team-based system** consisting of:
- A **web application module** for visualization and control
- A **hardware (IoT) module** using ESP32, GPS, and GSM for real-time ambulance tracking

Currently, the **web application module is completed** and uploaded.  
The **hardware module will be integrated and uploaded in the next phase**.

## My Role in the Project

- Designed and developed the **complete web application**
- Created the user interface for traffic signal visualization
- Implemented front-end logic using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Handled project structure and documentation

## Note

This is a **team project**.  
The web application was developed by me, while the hardware module is handled by a teammate.  
The repository will be updated once full hardware integration is completed.
